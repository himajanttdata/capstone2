## Code Quality Analysis

### Feedback on the Code

#### 1. **Is the code readable and modular?**
   - **Strengths:**
     - The code is fairly readable, with clear separation of methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `checkBalance`).
     - The use of a `while` loop and `switch` statement in the `main` method makes the program flow easy to follow.
   - **Areas for Improvement:**
     - The `main` method is handling too many responsibilities (user input, calling methods, and managing program flow). Extracting the menu logic into a separate method would improve modularity.
     - There is a duplicate declaration of the `checkBalance` method, which needs to be removed to avoid redundancy.

#### 2. **Are naming conventions followed?**
   - **Strengths:**
     - Method names (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `checkBalance`) follow Java's camelCase naming convention.
     - Variable names like `amount`, `depositAmount`, and `withdrawAmount` are descriptive and clear.
   - **Areas for Improvement:**
     - The class name `BankingSystem` could be more specific, such as `BankAccount` or `SimpleBankingSystem`, to better reflect its purpose.
     - The variable `choice` could be renamed to something more descriptive, like `menuOption`, to clarify its purpose.

#### 3. **Is it well-structured?**
   - **Strengths:**
     - The class is structured logically, with fields, methods, and the `main` method in a clear order.
     - Input validation is handled in both the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods, which is good practice.
   - **Areas for Improvement:**
     - The `Scanner` object is not closed, which can lead to resource leaks. Consider using a `try-with-resources` block or explicitly closing the scanner.
     - The `switch` statement in the `main` method could benefit from comments or better organization for readability.
     - The `checkBalance` method is duplicated in the code snippet, which is likely a mistake. This should be fixed to avoid redundancy.

## Bug Detection

### 1. **Duplicate `checkBalance` Method**
   - **Issue:** Duplicate method definitions are not allowed in Java unless overloaded. This will result in a compilation error.
   - **Fix:** Remove the duplicate `checkBalance()` method.

### 2. **Resource Leak: Scanner Not Closed**
   - **Issue:** The `Scanner` object is not closed after use, which can lead to resource leaks.
   - **Fix:** Use a `try-with-resources` block or explicitly close the scanner before exiting the program.

### 3. **Potential Infinite Loop on Invalid Input**
   - **Issue:** If a non-integer value is entered for the menu, the program will throw an `InputMismatchException` and enter an infinite loop.
   - **Fix:** Validate input using `scanner.hasNextInt()` and handle invalid input gracefully.

### 4. **Logic Issue: Negative Withdrawal Amount**
   - **Issue:** The withdrawal method does not explicitly handle negative amounts, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
   - **Fix:** Add a check for negative amounts and provide a meaningful error message.

### 5. **Improper Handling of Exit Condition**
   - **Issue:** Using `return` to exit the program is not ideal for readability and maintainability.
   - **Fix:** Replace `return` with `break` and add a condition to exit the loop.

## Suggested Improvements

1. **Refactor the `main` method**:
   - Extract the menu logic into a separate method, e.g., `displayMenu()`, to improve modularity and readability.

2. **Fix the duplicate `checkBalance` method**:
   - Remove the duplicate declaration of `checkBalance`.

3. **Close the `Scanner` object**:
   - Use a `try-with-resources` block to ensure the scanner is properly closed.

4. **Improve naming**:
   - Rename `choice` to `menuOption` for better clarity.
   - Consider renaming the class to something more specific, like `BankAccount`.

5. **Add comments**:
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of each method and key sections of the code, especially in the `main` method.

6. **Handle edge cases**:
   - Handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric input for the menu or amounts) to make the program more robust.

7. **Use `BigDecimal` for monetary values**:
   - Replace `double` with `BigDecimal` to avoid floating-point precision issues.

## Optimization Suggestions

1. **Avoid Floating-Point Precision Issues**:
   - Use `BigDecimal` instead of `double` for monetary values to ensure accuracy.

2. **Reduce Scanner Resource Usage**:
   - Ensure the `Scanner` object is closed properly to prevent resource leaks.

3. **Validate Input**:
   - Add input validation to ensure the user enters valid numeric values and handle exceptions gracefully.

4. **Extract Reusable Code**:
   - Combine repetitive code blocks (e.g., menu options) into reusable methods.

5. **Thread Safety**:
   - Synchronize access to the `balance` variable if the class is used in a multithreaded environment.

## Summary

- **Code Quality:** Needs Improvement  
- **Bugs:** Minor  
- **Optimization:** Recommended  

---

## Conclusion

The code is functional but not yet production-ready. It requires further work to address the identified bugs, improve modularity, and handle edge cases. Additionally, optimizations such as using `BigDecimal` for monetary values and improving input validation should be implemented to ensure robustness and precision.
